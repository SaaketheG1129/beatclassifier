# Hip-hop Instrumental Classifier

## Background

A new wave in music, shaping how hip-hop artists find instrumentals is "Type Beats". "Type Beats" refer to instrumentals that fit a specific 
well-known artist's sound. For example, a quick search on Youtube for "Drake Type Beat" will yield thousands of results of instrumentals similar to Drake's sound. This classification of beats into a specific artist(s) is particularly effective for producers to convey the musical character of their tracks' since listeners know the artist as well. I wanted to see if I could use machine learning to classify my beats for me!
